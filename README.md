# CPP-modules
The first five C++ modules at Hive Helsinki

Each exercise contains a makefile which will compile the executable. The purpose of these modules
is to serve as an introduction to C++, and as such it focuses on using different aspects of the language,
particularly the ways in which it differs from C, such as classes, inheritance, using the standard library,
function and operator overloading and more.
